# Commercial and Pilot Strategy

## Primary Customer Segment
- District education administrations and school clusters (public + affordable private)
- Decision makers: district admin + school principals
- Daily operators: teachers and health coordinators

## Adoption Path
1. District onboarding for 10-20 schools
2. Baseline capture (risk profile, intervention lag, parent outreach rate)
3. 8-week pilot with weekly review
4. Expand to additional clusters based on KPI improvements

## Pricing Hypothesis
- Pilot phase: fixed implementation fee
- Post-pilot: per-school annual subscription
- Optional premium: advanced analytics and multilingual communication packs

## Proof Metrics for Procurement
- Time-to-intervention reduction after high-risk detection
- Parent outreach completion and acknowledgement rate
- High-risk student percentage trend over 8 weeks
- Attendance trend improvement in intervention cohorts

## Execution Risk Controls
- GenAI dependency risk: template fallback and deterministic messaging paths
- Infrastructure sleep/wakeup risk: frontend-triggered `/warmup` endpoint
- Data reliability risk: schema validation and audit logs

## 12-Week Milestones
- Weeks 1-2: baseline and data mapping
- Weeks 3-4: pilot launch and ops training
- Weeks 5-8: monitoring and threshold tuning
- Weeks 9-10: KPI evaluation
- Weeks 11-12: procurement-ready impact report
